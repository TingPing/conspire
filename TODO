TODO
- Implement a sane theme engine
- Rewrite the ignore system so that it's actually worth using
- Add irssi-style tabcompletion alongside the bash-style implementation and
  provide a toggle
- Possibly implement hilight notifications through a pane above or below the
  main view so users can see why they're being hilighted even if the message
  has scrolled out of view or the user has scrolled up for whatever reason
- Rewrite hilights to be more powerful than the current implementation, with
  potential per-server/per-channel hilights support
- Get rid of all "homebrew" tree/blahblahblah shit, replace with GLib/Mowgli
  primitives where appropriate.
- replace OpenSSL with GnuTLS.
