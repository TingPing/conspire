conspire 0.10.0 (01-??-2008):

  * OpenSSL support has been removed in favour of GnuTLS.
    As GnuTLS is 100% definitely licensed in compatibility with
    the GPL, this means that distributions will be able to enable
    the SSL support.
  * Add support for extracting colours from your system's GTK+ theme.
  * New icons care of Chris Fuenty.
  * Add support for the MONITOR command on charybdis and ircd-ratbox
    daemons (thanks to AndroSyn!)
  * Fix a bug where the colourmap didn't match up with mIRC's colours.
  * Remove inline pixbufs, reducing the binary size by a large amount.
    Now pixbufs are loaded from disk, and can be replaced by editing
    the PNG files in ${datadir}/conspire/pixmaps.
  * Start to move some various aspects of the code to Mowgli.
  * Add rudimentary launcher.
