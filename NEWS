conspire 0.20~beta2 (06-??-2008):

  * Add support for STARTTLS; this is used by InspIRCd 1.2 or later.
    For details about the protocol, see http://inspircd.org/wiki/STARTTLS_Documentation
  * Use NotifyNotification objects instead of spawning a process and calling
    notify-send. This allows for superior desktop integration, but causes libnotify
    to become a hard dependency. This seems ok though, as most users already have it.
  * Rewrite capability negotiation subsystem to be asynchronous.
  * Adjust height of cell renderers to fit more entries into the chanview and userlist.
    (This idea was taken from the XChat 2.8.6 release.)
  * Implement a new TreeView widget which looks similar to that of Gossip and Pidgin.

conspire 0.20~beta1 (06-07-2008):

  * Entirely new event processing engine and signals API.
  * DBus support dropped; use the new Plugin API.
  * Support for XChat plugins dropped.
  * New plugin API, things are not entirely set in stone yet.
    (Some example plugins are in src/plugins, if you have any questions,
     ask on our IRC channel.)
  * Several UI improvements, including more use of context-sensitive menus.
  * New implementation of XText using Cairo.
  * Replace old message-splitting system for /say with new one for /msg, /me, and /say.
  * Add support for CTCP TIME.
  * /quit disconnects from one server again due to user request.
  * /exit disconnects from all servers before exiting, similar to irssi.
  * /all* has been replaced with /foreach.
  * Restored options to the GUI that were removed in xchat.
  * Add new options for new functionality provided in Conspire.

conspire 0.12.0 (01-30-2008):

  * Remove CTCP sound support; it's worthless.
  * Handle CTCP replies in a better way.
  * /quit now disconnects from all servers; to disconnect from one, use /disconnect instead.
  * Improve coloured nicks support.
  * Add support for CTCP CLIENTINFO.

conspire 0.11.0 (01-16-2008):

  * Fix several bugs in the SASL (IAL) implementation.
  * Add regexp search and replace options.
  * Implement support for immutable windows.
  * Fix some SSL bugs.
  * Rewrite the lowlevel configuration manager.
  * Fix a long standing bug in the network editor: Remove didn't work.

conspire 0.10.0 (01-01-2008):

  * OpenSSL support has been removed in favour of GnuTLS.
    As GnuTLS is 100% definitely licensed in compatibility with
    the GPL, this means that distributions will be able to enable
    the SSL support.
  * Add support for extracting colours from your system's GTK+ theme.
  * New icons care of Chris Fuenty.
  * Add support for the MONITOR command on charybdis and ircd-ratbox
    daemons (thanks to AndroSyn!)
  * Fix a bug where the colourmap didn't match up with mIRC's colours.
  * Remove inline pixbufs, reducing the binary size by a large amount.
    Now pixbufs are loaded from disk, and can be replaced by editing
    the PNG files in ${datadir}/conspire/pixmaps.
  * Start to move some various aspects of the code to Mowgli.
  * Add rudimentary launcher.
  * Make /part accept "/part reason" syntax; where it parts from the
    current channel.
  * Add support for SASL. At the moment, SASL passwords are stored in
    plain text. Eventually, they will be MD5'd or something. Additionally,
    only the PLAIN mechanism is supported. Some servers support DH-BLOWFISH,
    but that requires more work and will wait until 0.11.
