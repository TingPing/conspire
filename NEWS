conspire 0.11.0 (01-16-2008):

  * Fix several bugs in the SASL (IAL) implementation.
  * Add regexp search and replace options.
  * Implement support for immutable windows.
  * Fix some SSL bugs.
  * Rewrite the lowlevel configuration manager.
  * Fix a long standing bug in the network editor: Remove didn't work.

conspire 0.10.0 (01-01-2008):

  * OpenSSL support has been removed in favour of GnuTLS.
    As GnuTLS is 100% definitely licensed in compatibility with
    the GPL, this means that distributions will be able to enable
    the SSL support.
  * Add support for extracting colours from your system's GTK+ theme.
  * New icons care of Chris Fuenty.
  * Add support for the MONITOR command on charybdis and ircd-ratbox
    daemons (thanks to AndroSyn!)
  * Fix a bug where the colourmap didn't match up with mIRC's colours.
  * Remove inline pixbufs, reducing the binary size by a large amount.
    Now pixbufs are loaded from disk, and can be replaced by editing
    the PNG files in ${datadir}/conspire/pixmaps.
  * Start to move some various aspects of the code to Mowgli.
  * Add rudimentary launcher.
  * Make /part accept "/part reason" syntax; where it parts from the
    current channel.
  * Add support for SASL. At the moment, SASL passwords are stored in
    plain text. Eventually, they will be MD5'd or something. Additionally,
    only the PLAIN mechanism is supported. Some servers support DH-BLOWFISH,
    but that requires more work and will wait until 0.11.
